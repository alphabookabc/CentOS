# Reference
Can't I just use a hotcopy to restore the repository?
It depends, hotcopies created with svnadmin hotcopy must be moved to a server with identical setup. You should have the same version of subversion installed on both servers, same operating system, etc.
Subversion dumps are designed to work with different versions of subversion, and are just more flexible. Hotcopies are handy to have, but I recommend creating both hotcopies and dumps as part of your backup plan.
